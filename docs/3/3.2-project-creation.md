# Project Creation

Please submit a project setup request email to [support@fastfeedback.rocks](mailto:support@fastfeedback.rocks) to request a project space for your team.

In the email, please include your team name, list of team members and the name of your team's slack channel.

Our support team will create projects for you in Jenkins, JIRA, Confluence and Bitbucket and will respond back with links to your projects. We will also provide you with the following settings that should be included in any Jenkinsfile you create for your team:

```
SLACK_CHANNEL = "teamchannel"
BITBUCKET_GROUP = "TEAMKEY"
DEPLOY_DOMAIN = "app-x.fastfeedback.rocks"
```

You can download an example Jenkinsfile [here](http://bitbucket.fastfeedback.rocks/projects/AFD/repos/example-jenkinsfiles/browse).
