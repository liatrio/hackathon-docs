# Anaylze Code with SonarQube

In the code analysis stage of a pipeline, a code analysis tool such as SonarQube is used to ensure the code changes are up to defined standards for a project.

In this example, a shared library function call, `analyzeWithSonar()`, is ran on a Maven container, `maven:3.5.0`.

## Example Jenkinsfile Pipeline Stage
```groovy
stage('Analyze code with Sonar') {
	agent {
		docker {
			image 'maven:3.5.0'
		}
	}
	steps {
		script {
			STAGE = env.STAGE_NAME
		}
		analyzeWithSonar()
	}
}
```
