# Push Docker Image to Artifactory

In this stage, a Docker image is built using source-code and the resulting image is then pushed to an artifact repository.

In this example, the shared library function call `buildAndPushContainer()` first packages the code into a Docker image by referencing a `Dockerfile` within the repository and then pushes the resulting image to Artifactory.

## Example Jenkinsfile Pipeline Stage
```groovy
stage('Build and push container') {
	agent any
		steps {
			script {
				STAGE = env.STAGE_NAME
			}
			buildAndPushContainer()
		}
}
```
