# Build

During the Build stage, the agent to be used is first specified as a Docker image. In the following example, a Maven image is used.

Using the specified [Maven image](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/), `maven:3.5.0`, a container is ran by Jenkins and the `mavenBuildAndDeploy()` shared library function call builds the application using Maven.

Jenkins will also have the relevant Jira issue tag echoed to the build console output as noted with `echo "jira issue ${JIRA_ISSUE}"`.  The variable `JIRA_ISSUE` is populated via a shared libary function call, `getJiraIssue()`.

## Example Jenkinsfile Pipeline Stage
```groovy
stage('Build') {
	agent {
		docker {
			image 'maven:3.5.0'
		}
	}
	steps {
		script {
			STAGE = env.STAGE_NAME
				JIRA_ISSUE = getJiraIssue()
				echo "jira issue ${JIRA_ISSUE}"
		}
		mavenBuildAndDeploy()
	}
}
```
