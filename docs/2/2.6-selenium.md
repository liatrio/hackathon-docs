# Test Functionality with Selenium

In this stage, the Maven image is specified as the desired agent as in previous stages.

Then, using `mvn test`, the application is tested by Selenium.

## Example Jenkinsfile Pipeline Stage
```groovy
stage('Functional test With Selenium') {
	agent {
		docker {
			image 'maven:3.5.0'
				args "--net \$DOCKER_NET"
		}
	}
	steps {
		script { STAGE = env.STAGE_NAME }
		sh "cd regression-suite && \
			mvn clean -B test -DPETCLINIC_URL=http://credit-card:8080/credit-card "
	}
}
```
