# Pipeline Stages

In this chapter, you can read about and see examples of different stages of the example pipeline. You can also view this pipeline in [Jenkins](http://jenkins.fastfeedback.rocks/).

Jenkins pipelines can be defined as code in source-control through the use of a Jenkinsfile.

You can access example Jenkinsfiles in the [example-jenkinsfiles repo](http://bitbucket.fastfeedback.rocks/projects/AFD/repos/example-jenkinsfiles/browse).
